# Chat with PDFs

Imagine a revolutionary Chatbot that effortlessly transforms PDF documents into interactive knowledge hubs. Powered by state-of-the-art AI algorithms and seamlessly integrated with Google's generative AI, this Chatbot represents the pinnacle of modern information retrieval and conversation technology.

At its core lies the remarkable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, a breakthrough in natural language understanding and generation. This innovative architecture enables the Chatbot to not only comprehend the content of PDFs but also to respond to inquiries with human-like fluency and accuracy.

Behind the scenes, a powerful ensemble of libraries including PyPDF2 for PDF processing, faiss-cpu for efficient similarity search, and langchain for seamless integration of language technologies work harmoniously to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
